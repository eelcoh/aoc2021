# Advent of Code 2021

This is an attempt to write the Advent of Code in Elm, but using the CLI from [Elm Posix](https://github.com/albertdahlin/elm-posix).

To run an example, you need to have installed [Elm Posix] (https://github.com/albertdahlin/elm-posix).


Then for example, you can run the code with this:

```
â†’ elm-cli run src/Day2.elm inputs/day2.txt
we moved 15 down
and we moved 10 forward
```

This runs the source for day 2, with the input for day 2. Obviously you can try to run the source for day 2 with the input for day 1, but that will not result in interesting output.
